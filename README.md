# py-image-dedup

**py-image-dedup** is a tool to scan through a library of photos, find duplicates and remove them
in a prioritized way.

It is build upon [Image-Match](https://github.com/ascribe/image-match) a very popular library to compute
a pHash for an image and store the result in an ElasticSearch backend for very high scalability.

# Work in progress

This library is still a work in progress

# How to use
